## Description  

**Who are we?**  
Hi! My name is [Meidad Troper](https://github.com/Meidad-T) and together with team members [Vaidic Soni](https://github.com/vaidicsoni), [Kelvin Mathew](https://github.com/KelvinMathew2004), [Priyanka Karki](https://github.com/pri682), and [Jesse Flynn](https://github.com/Dr-DefiChain?tab=overview&from=2024-12-01&to=2024-12-31) we created bRUSH! The new social media app.  

**What are we creating?**  
In short, this is a mobile social media app that aims at connecting everyone to their creative side as well as connect people closer. The app is aimed at anyone ages 12 to 22 though we believe it will be enjoyable even among families, sharing drawings with your parents.  

bRUSH! is a mobile app inspired by BeReal, where all users world wide get a notification at the same time letting them know it is time to skecth! what are they bRUSHing? whatever the random, funny, bizzare, weird promt was generated for that day! every user, world wide - will all be drawing THE SAME THING at the SAME TIME talk about synchronization.... (sorry, bad programmer joke).  

Users will have a pre determined amount of time to complete their daily drawing. before they have to submit it.  

After a user has submitted their drawing, they are presented with all of their friends drawings! Again, same promt... and that is where the fun begin!  

each user is granted medals they can award each day.  
A gold medal can be awarded once per day, to the user's favorite drawing.  
A silver medal can be awarded once per day for the user's second favorite drawing.  
And of course a bronze medal can be awarded once per day for the user's third favorite bRUSH.  

In addition, every user is given an unlimited number of "participation medals" which they can award to all the drawings they hated.... Just kidding... they can be awarded to the drawings the user recognizes as impressive, but simply we'rent in the top 3 that day in the user's opinion.  

Each user grants those medals to their friends or family... but don't forget... the user also has the chance to be awarded medals of their own from their friends or family! resulting in a friendly and fun competition... who can earn the most gold medals?  

**Who are we doing it for?**  
The app is aimed at anyone ages 12 to 22 though we believe it will be enjoyable even among families, sharing drawings with your parents.  

**Why are we doing this?**  
Now, you might be hearing all of this... and wonder- but why? what's the point..? it doesn't really solve any global issue... it doesn't save lives, and it most certainly doesn't leave the world a better place... so what even if the point??  

Well... According to a recent research, About 45% of students world wide report wishing they had more opportunities to express themselves creatively or artistically but can't. It was also found that 80% of people believe unlocking creativity is critical to economic growth. [1]  

Our platform is just the place to do so. People of all ages could take their very own twist at our random bRUSH prompts, and truly express themselves in them. While the app aims to be fun and easy going, it also enables those students craving to express themselves the platform to do so, without being jujged.  

bRUSH! Aims to connect people, unlock creative thinking, and bring more color to the world (literally).
