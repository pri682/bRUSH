## Description  

**Who are we?**  
Hi! My name is [Meidad Troper](https://github.com/Meidad-T) and together with team members [Vaidic Soni](https://github.com/vaidicsoni), [Kelvin Mathew](https://github.com/KelvinMathew2004), [Priyanka Karki](https://github.com/pri682), and [Jesse Flynn](https://github.com/jeaflynn) we created bRUSH! The new social media app.  

**What are we creating?**  
In short, this is a mobile social media app that aims at connecting everyone to their creative side as well as connect people closer. The app is aimed at anyone ages 12 to 22 though we believe it will be enjoyable even among families, sharing drawings with your parents.  

bRUSH! is a mobile app inspired by BeReal, where all users world wide get a notification at the same time letting them know it is time to skecth! what are they bRUSHing? whatever the random, funny, bizzare, weird promt was generated for that day! every user, world wide - will all be drawing THE SAME THING at the SAME TIME talk about synchronization.... (sorry, bad programmer joke).  

Users will have a pre determined amount of time to complete their daily drawing. before they have to submit it.  

After a user has submitted their drawing, they are presented with all of their friends drawings! Again, same promt... and that is where the fun begin!  

each user is granted medals they can award each day.  
A gold medal can be awarded once per day, to the user's favorite drawing.  
A silver medal can be awarded once per day for the user's second favorite drawing.  
And of course a bronze medal can be awarded once per day for the user's third favorite bRUSH.  

In addition, every user is given an unlimited number of "participation medals" which they can award to all the drawings they hated.... Just kidding... they can be awarded to the drawings the user recognizes as impressive, but simply we'rent in the top 3 that day in the user's opinion.  

Each user grants those medals to their friends or family... but don't forget... the user also has the chance to be awarded medals of their own from their friends or family! resulting in a friendly and fun competition... who can earn the most gold medals?  

**Who are we doing it for?**  
The app is aimed at anyone ages 12 to 22 though we believe it will be enjoyable even among families, sharing drawings with your parents.  

**Why are we doing this?**  
Now, you might be hearing all of this... and wonder- but why? what's the point..? it doesn't really solve any global issue... it doesn't save lives, and it most certainly doesn't leave the world a better place... so what even if the point??  

Well... According to a recent research, About 45% of students world wide report wishing they had more opportunities to express themselves creatively or artistically but can't. It was also found that 80% of people believe unlocking creativity is critical to economic growth. [1]  

Our platform is just the place to do so. People of all ages could take their very own twist at our random bRUSH prompts, and truly express themselves in them. While the app aims to be fun and easy going, it also enables those students craving to express themselves the platform to do so, without being jujged.  

bRUSH! Aims to connect people, unlock creative thinking, and bring more color to the world (literally).

### ðŸ‘¤ Jesse Flynn

ðŸ”— [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-nemoidians-f25/brush/commits/branch/KAN-18-as-a-user-i-want-to-have-a-friends-tab-to-view-and-compete-with-my-friends)

- Added Leaderboard section in Friends page with ranking, points, refresh, and error/empty states

*Note: KAN-18 (Friends tab) was accidentally merged into main instead of the sprint1-dev branch. As a result, when I created the KAN-19 branch and 
merged it into sprint1-dev, it also included the KAN-18 commits. These commits were already reviewed and merged to main earlier. KAN-19 contains only the 
leaderboard-related changes, but the history shows both sets because of the branch base. This was not an attempt to duplicate or fake work - just a branch 
merge mistake that I wanted to add here for clarity.*

#### **Next Steps** 
- Friends Backend Integration (Firebase)
	- Connect Add Friend flow to real Firebase users using handles
	- Implement friend request creation, acceptance, and persistence with Firestore
	- Update FriendsViewModel to use live user data instead of mock arrays
- Leaderboard Backend Integration
	- Implement Firebase logic to query friendsâ€™ submissions and calculate medal totals
	- Replace stub service with real Firestore queries using filters for friend IDs
	- Ensure leaderboard updates on refresh and matches real medal counts
- Testing and Polish
	- Add unit tests for FriendsViewModel search and leaderboard sorting logic
	- Clean up any UI bugs or state resets between tabs
